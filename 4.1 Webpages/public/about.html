<h1>Then, come as close as you'd like!!!</h1>
<p>My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married.<br />
   I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. <br />
   I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. <br />
   After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.<br />
   Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. <br />
  I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. <br />
  I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.<br />
   That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. <br />
  Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>

<p>You know Paris, France? In English, it's pronounced "Paris" but everyone else pronounces it without the "s" sound, like the French do.<br />
   But with Venezia, everyone pronouces it the English way: "Venice". Like 'The Merchant of Venice' or 'Death in Venice'. <br />
  WHY, THOUGH!? WHY ISN'T THE TITLE DEATH IN VENEZIA!? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!? <br />
  IT TAKES PLACE IN ITALY, SO USE THE ITALIAN WORD, DAMMIT! THAT SHIT PISSES ME OFF! BUNCH OF DUMBASSES!.</p>

<p>Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. <br />
  The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? <br />
  The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. <br />
  That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’.<br />
   The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes?<br />
    If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin.<br />
     The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option.<br />
   This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? <br />
  There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? <br />
  Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? <br />
  NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things!<br />
   The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! <br />
  In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! <br />
  In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle.<br />
   And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. <br />
  It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. <br />
  And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… <br />
  Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.</p>
